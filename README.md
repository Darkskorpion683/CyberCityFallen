Walkthrough:
In order to beat the game, you will need to kill waves of enemies and pick up XP drops that fill your XP bar. Filling the XP bar gives you an upgrade menu in which you can select new weapons or upgrade them to become stronger. Additionally, there are upgrades that provide player stat boosts. The game is lost when player health reaches 0. The game is won when the player can survive 10 minutes without dying. Some tips and tricks for those who have never played this style of game: Try and always be moving, moving in a large circular radius will "train" the enemies into a hoard that is more easily avoidable than many randomly placed enemies. Make sure to focus on collecting XP orbs as this is how your player stats progress and scale with the enemy strength. A quick movement towards the enemies timed with the auto-attack will allow you to hit the enemy and back away to safety before being hit by them. The slash/base weapon is the hardest to use, it is directional so you must be facing the enemy to hit them. The projectile weapon will shoot towards the nearest enemy automatically and the AOE weapon is a passive ring around the player also dealing damage. These weapons stack rather than replace previous weapons. The base enemies are the weakest, they have normal coloring. There is some pace to the game in that you need to be leveling up quickly because blue level 2 enemies spawn after 3 minutes and green level 3 after 5ish minutes.
